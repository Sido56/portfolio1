                <h1> Syrus Souza-Lane </h1>
                <p>  My name is Syrus Souza-Lane. I was born on Oct 19, 2005 in Waipahu, I currently live in aiea. I am currently a senior about to graduate. I do want to be able to become a game designer or just help make a game because it seems to be very fun. When I go to college I want to learn how to do coding better.

                <h2>  What are my hobbies and interests? </h2>
                <p> I really like to play video games. It's so fun being able to do something in a different world and be able to be who you want to be and leave behind your current problems. I like listening to music. I don't really have a favorite genre or artists. I listen to a wide variety of songs. But the things I don't like to listen to are rock and other things like that due to it being a little too loud for me. I also enjoy drawing. I don't draw too often but it is really fun and I'm still trying to get better at it. I'm not too fond of reading books but if there is mystery or a lot of twist and action in it I could read the book for hours. I also watch anime in my free time. Some anime are devil man crybaby, cyberpunk edgerunners, or demon slayer just to name a few.  </p>

                <h3>Video Game Design Project</h3>
                <p> The game my team made is called “Eternal moth & Bee”. you are going to play as the two characters moth and bee. The moth's name is Atlas and the bee's name is bridget. They have to travel the land to go collect items to help save their forest from becoming corrupted. They have to defeat bosses to get the items that are required to make a potion to save the day. The game teaches survival and math skills. There are also shops and other people that you can meet on your journey like shopkeepers and guards just to name some of them. But the end goal will be very hard to get to so be prepared to fight and survive.</p>

                <h4> Scratch Project </h4>
                <p>  The project that I made by using scratch was a catching game. The game catch isnt to hard to understand, you just need to catch the item falling from the top of the screen. The changes I made to the game was to change the background, the character you play as, and the item you have to catch. The buttons are very simple. All you have to do is use the left and right keys in order to move the character to catch the item falling from the top of the screen. The coding for the game was semi hard to make because when i was messing around i figured how to move the characters and to get the item to drop from the top of the screen. I hope that we are able to code for other games due to them being hard and fun to make and get to play. The link to my game will be provided, https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/801662575 </p>

   <h5> Arduino project </h5>
                 <p> for the arduino project we had three choices to make it was between a buzzez, space intermision or a trafic light. I chose to make a buzzer. We had to add one more feature onto it so I add three different lights onto the device. I also had it play the legend of zelda theme song even you cant really hear it though.
